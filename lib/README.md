Some of the libraries in this directories have been copied from other projects.
We should find a proper way to import them to avoid having to keep those in
synchrony.

  - `utils` is copied from [biot](https://bitbucket.org/enbygg3/biot/)
  - `templater` also comes from [biot](https://bitbucket.org/enbygg3/biot/).
    There are other similar Tcl [implementations](http://wiki.tcl.tk/18175)
    around, we might want to look into them at some point.
